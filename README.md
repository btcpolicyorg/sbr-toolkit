The State-Level Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Toolkit is a modular, plug-and-play legislative framework designed to help U.S. states adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset to strengthen fiscal resilience, monetary sovereignty, and economic competitiveness. By offering a menu of adaptable policy components, the toolkit empowers lawmakers to tailor a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to their state’s specific needs and priorities. It covers the full lifecycle of Bitcoin treasury adoption—from procurement and custody to disaster recovery, environmental integration, and public transparency—while offering flexible options for funding acquisitions through budget surpluses, seized assets, or municipal “BitBond” issuances. States can choose from a range of tested strategies to advance economic development, promote energy innovation, and safeguard digital property rights. The result is a turnkey framework to support long-term financial leadership with Bitcoin at the foundation.
