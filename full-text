SECTION 1. FINDINGS
The Legislature finds and declares that:
(a) MONETARY SOVEREIGNTY AND FISCAL RESILIENCE: The State of _____ recognizes that Bitcoin represents a paradigm shift in monetary technology that offers states an opportunity to diversify treasury holdings, hedge against currency debasement, and enhance long-term fiscal stability. As a decentralized, bearer asset with a mathematically fixed supply cap of twenty-one million units, Bitcoin provides characteristics unavailable in traditional reserve assets subject to counterparty risk and monetary policy manipulation.
(b) INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION AND MARKET MATURATION: Bitcoin has achieved institutional legitimacy through adoption by publicly traded corporations, regulated financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and nation-states. The approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded products by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, coupled with regulatory clarity from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission recognizing Bitcoin as a commodity, establishes a mature regulatory framework supporting institutional custody and investment.
(c) PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT: Academic research and empirical analysis demonstrate that Bitcoin exhibits low correlation with traditional asset classes, including equities, bonds, and commodities, providing meaningful diversification benefits to institutional portfolios. The asset's performance characteristics over multiple market cycles indicate potential for enhanced risk-adjusted returns when incorporated into diversified investment strategies.
(d) TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY: The Bitcoin network represents the most secure and robust distributed computing system ever deployed, protected by cryptographic proof-of-work consensus mechanisms and validated by a global network of independent nodes. This technological infrastructure provides unparalleled settlement finality and resistance to censorship, manipulation, or systemic failure compared to traditional financial systems dependent on centralized intermediaries.
(e) ENERGY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS: Bitcoin mining operations present unique opportunities for states to monetize stranded energy resources, reduce methane emissions through flare gas capture, and stabilize renewable energy grids by providing responsive load balancing. The ability to convert otherwise wasted energy into economic value while supporting environmental remediation aligns with state interests in sustainable resource management.
(f) ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: States that proactively embrace Bitcoin infrastructure and investment positioning establish competitive advantages in attracting digital asset businesses, financial technology companies, and blockchain developers. Early adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies signals technological leadership and creates opportunities for enhanced tax revenue through business attraction and retention.
(g) CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY: State treasurers and investment officials possess constitutional and statutory authority to invest public funds in assets that serve the public interest and preserve purchasing power for future generations. Bitcoin's characteristics as digital property with demonstrable store-of-value properties support its inclusion within state investment portfolios as a prudent exercise of fiduciary responsibility.
(h) PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS: The establishment of state-level Bitcoin reserves affirms and protects fundamental property rights in digital assets while demonstrating governmental commitment to technological innovation and financial sovereignty. State investment in Bitcoin validates the legitimacy of private Bitcoin ownership and strengthens legal precedents protecting individual property rights in digital assets.
